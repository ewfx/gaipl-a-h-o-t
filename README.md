## 💡 Inspiration
What inspired you to create this project? Describe the problem you're solving.

1. In the current project, after seeing the incidents that are being raised and the amount of manual effort that is being performed. We observed a lot of possibilities where we can automate the process with the current cutting edge technologies.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Explain the key features and functionalities of your project.

## Currrent System--> Incident Resolution process for failures:

	## Incident Detection and Notification:
	
	1. Upon the failure of an Autosys job/ITRS Portal/AppD/Elastic API portals, an automated event is generated and transmitted to the **Triage system**.
	2. The ** Triage system ** subsequently forwards this event to the ** BigPanda platform ** based on the APPID and priority.
	3. ** BigPanda ** aggregates the event data and automatically generates a service ticket within the ServiceNow platform.
	4. This ServiceNow ticket, containing relevant incident information, is routed to the ** designated support group ** responsible for the affected service.
	
	## Current Incident Response and Resolution (Manual effort):
	
	1. A member of the designated support group receives notification of the ServiceNow ticket.
	2. The support team member accesses the relevant machine, checks their email for notifications, and logs into the ServiceNow portal.
	3. The support team member validates the ticket details and accesses the ServiceNow knowledge base (Kbase).
	4. If a matching Kbase article is identified, the support team member associates the Kbase article with the incident ticket.
	5. The support team member then initiates the resolution process based on the instructions provided in the associated Kbase article.
	6. If a matching Kbase article is not found, or if the Kbase resolution is unsuccessful, the support team member escalates the incident to the application development (App Dev) team for further 		investigation and resolution.

## Proposed GenAI-Agentic System (Automated):

Automated Incident Detection and Initial Analysis (Agentic AI & LLMs):

1. Agentic AI:
   An agent will monitor the Autosys system for job failures. Upon detection, it will automatically trigger the creation of an incident event.

2. Or an Agent continously monitors the servicenow incidents (Servicenow provides service end points that agent can monitor).
   
## LLM-Powered Event Analysis: 
The agent will use an LLM to analyze the failure logs and error messages generated by Autosys. 
 This analysis will:
	Extract key information such as job name, failure time, error codes, and relevant system logs.
	Summarize the failure cause and potential impact.
	Generate an initial incident report containing these details.
## Automated Ticket Creation and Routing: 
The agent will automatically create a ServiceNow ticket based on the LLM-generated incident report. The ticket will be routed to the appropriate support group based on predefined rules and LLM-assisted classification.

## BigPanda Integration: 
The Agent can also communicate with BigPanda, and automate the aggregation of events, and provide a richer context to the Servicenow ticket.

## Automated Knowledge Base (Kbase) Matching and Resolution (GenAI & LLMs):

LLM-Powered Kbase Search: The agent will use an LLM to search the ServiceNow Kbase for relevant articles based on the incident report and failure logs.
Semantic Similarity Matching: The LLM will perform semantic similarity matching to identify Kbase articles that address the root cause of the failure, rather than relying on keyword matching.
Automated Resolution Recommendation: If a relevant Kbase article is found, the LLM will:
Extract the resolution steps from the article.
Generate a summary of the resolution steps in a concise and actionable format.
Automatically update the ServiceNow ticket with the recommended resolution.
Agentic execution: The Agent can be configured to attempt to execute the resolution steps, when automated execution is deemed safe.
Confidence Scoring: The LLM will provide a confidence score for the Kbase match, indicating the likelihood that the article provides the correct resolution.

## Automated Escalation and App Dev Interaction (Agentic AI & LLMs):

LLM-Powered Escalation Criteria: If no relevant Kbase article is found, or if the confidence score is below a threshold, the agent will automatically escalate the incident to the App Dev team.
Automated App Dev Notification: The agent will generate a detailed escalation report containing the incident details, failure logs, and LLM-generated analysis.
LLM-Powered Communication: The agent can use an LLM to generate clear and concise communication with the App Dev team, including questions and requests for information.
Automated Documentation: During the resolution process, the agent can automatically document the steps taken and the final resolution, creating new Kbase articles or updating existing ones.  

## Continuous Improvement and Learning (GenAI & LLMs):

Feedback Loop: The system will incorporate a feedback loop to capture human input and improve the accuracy of the LLM-powered analysis and resolution recommendations.
LLM Fine-tuning: The LLMs will be fine-tuned on historical incident data and resolution steps to improve their performance over time.   
Automated Kbase Maintenance: The system will automatically identify and update outdated Kbase articles, ensuring that the knowledge base remains accurate and relevant.

## Benefits:

1. Reduced incident resolution time.
2. Improved accuracy and consistency of incident resolution.
3. Reduced manual effort and human error.
4. Enhanced knowledge management and Kbase utilization.
5. Proactive incident prevention through pattern recognition and analysis.
6. Improved system uptime.
